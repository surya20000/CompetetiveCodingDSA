#Question Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
# You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

# A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

# For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
# Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]

# Output: [0,9]

# Explanation:

# The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
# The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]

# Output: []

# Explanation:

# There is no concatenated substring.

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]

# Output: [6,9,12]

# Explanation:

# The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
# The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
# The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].
