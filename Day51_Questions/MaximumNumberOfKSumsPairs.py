# Question Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

# You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

# In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

# Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
# - Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
# - Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
# There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
# - Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
# There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

# Solution 

def maxOperations(nums, k):
    count = 0
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        target = k - num
        if target in freq and freq[target] > 0:
            count += 1
            freq -= 1
        else:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
    return num
