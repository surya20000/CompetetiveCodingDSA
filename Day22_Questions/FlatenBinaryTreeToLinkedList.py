# #Question Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

# The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
# The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
# Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
# Example 2:

# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [0]
# Output: [0]

#Solution Class
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
