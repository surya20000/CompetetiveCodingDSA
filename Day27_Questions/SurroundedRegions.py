# You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

# Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
# Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
# Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
# A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the input matrix board.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

# Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
