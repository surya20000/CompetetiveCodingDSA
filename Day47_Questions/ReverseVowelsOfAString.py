# Question Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

# Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

# The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "IceCreAm"

# Output: "AceCreIm"

# Explanation:

# The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "leetcode"

# Output: "leotcede"

# Solution class
